EB-1A petitions are for individuals with extraordinary abilities and achievements who are at the very top of their field, industry or sport. One advantage of the EB-1A petition is that it does not require a job offer, and extraordinary individuals can petition for themselves without the help of an employer or family member.

The key to a successful EB-1A petition is demonstrating sustained acclaim (a pattern of high-level achievement and recognition) in the sciences, arts, education, business or athletics. Individuals can qualify if they won a major, internationally recognized award (Nobel, Oscar, Pulitzer, etc.), or they can qualify by proving at least three of the following:

list_start
- Nationally or internationally recognized awards
- Membership in associations that require members to have outstanding achievements
- Articles in professional or major media about the individual
- Invitations to judge the work of others in the field, industry or sport
- Original contributions of major significance
- Authorship of scholarly articles in professional journals or major media
- Displays at artistic exhibitions or showcases
- Leading or critical roles in distinguished organizations or top companies
- Significantly higher pay than others in the field, industry or sport
- Commercial success in the performing arts

Our attorneys represent extraordinary individuals in a wide range of scientific disciplines, art, music, education, business and sports. In addition to working with extraordinary individuals in established and popular areas of work, we regularly obtain approvals for individuals in obscure scientific fields, lesser-known sports and niche art. We offer a high-level of personalization and carefully describe our clients’ achievements in detail, emphasizing their importance through diligent comparative analysis.

        content: `EB-1B petitions are for professors and researchers who are outstanding in their academic fields with international recognition. Obtaining EB-1 classification is usually the fastest way to immigrate to the United States, since there is rarely a visa backlog and visas are quickly available.

EB-1B petitions require a “permanent” job offer from a U.S. employer. At colleges and universities, the job must be a tenure or tenure-track teaching position or a permanent research position. At other organizations, the job must be a permanent academic research position, and the organization must employ at least 3 researchers and have documented achievements in the field. Research positions that are renewable indefinitely or are commonly renewed in practice can be considered “permanent” for EB-1B petitions. Postdoctoral Fellows and Associate Professors with set term employment contracts usually meet the “permanent” requirement because these positions are usually renewable.

Individuals must be internationally recognized as outstanding in their particular academic field to qualify for EB-1B classification. To do so, individuals must be able to prove at least 2 of the following:

• Major prizes or awards
• Membership in associations that require members to have outstanding achievements
• Published material in professional publications about the individual’s work
• Participation as a judge of the work of others in the academic field
• Original scientific or scholarly research contributions
• Authorship of scholarly books or articles with international circulation

Individuals must also have at least 3 years of teaching and/or research experience. Teaching or research experience accumulated during a graduate program does not usually count, although it may if the teaching was done with a high level of responsibility or the research achieved significant recognition.

MT Law successfully represents outstanding professors and researchers in wide range of academic fields. In addition to working with extraordinary individuals at some of the most well-regarded research institutions in the United States, we regularly obtain approvals for individuals in smaller or newer research organizations. We offer a high-level of personalization and take care to describe our clients’ achievements in detail and emphasize their importance through diligent comparative analysis.

If you are an individual that thinks you might qualify for EB-1B classification, or if you are an employer who would like to sponsor a researcher for permanent residence, please contact us today for a consultation.`,

        content: `EB-1C classification is for high-level multinational executives and managers seeking permanent residence in the United States. The definitions of executive and managerial positions are extremely specific, and both require a high level of authority within the company.

EB-1C petitions require sponsorship from a multinational employer with offices in the United States and at least one other foreign country. The U.S. and foreign office(s) must have a qualifying corporate relationship, either having a direct majority-owned relationship or able to trace ownership back to a single parent company or group of shareholders. Additionally, the U.S. company must have been operating for at least one year and show income or investment sufficient to support the managerial or executive role.

The executive or manager must have worked for the foreign subsidiary or affiliate for one whole year within the three years immediately preceding entrance to the United States (either with a green card or with a temporary work visa). As one example, many EB-1C executives and managers start with L-1A nonimmigrant visas, which have similar requirements, and then apply for EB-1C classification.

MT Law successfully represents companies in wide range of industries, from large multinational corporations to small multinational trading companies. We offer detailed advice on business structure, investment, and high-level personnel organization to help companies meet their international staffing goals.

        content: `The U.S. government allows individuals that show great promise in work that is important to U.S. interests to skip the labor certification process and apply for permanent residence through a national interest waiver. The NIW is often the best choice for immigrants who are exceptional or have an advanced degree, but cannot meet the strict criteria for EB-1 classification. An advantage is that NIW petitions do not require a job offer, so individuals can petition for themselves, without the help of an employer or family member. Alternatively, an employer may choose to sponsor an employee under this program.

To obtain NIW approval, the individual must either possess an advanced degree (at least a master’s degree or a bachelor’s degree with at least five years of progressive experience) or have exceptional ability. Additionally, individuals must be able to prove at least 3 of the following:

• A degree or similar award from an institution of higher education related to the field
• Letters documenting at least 10 years of full-time experience in the field
• A license or certification to practice in the field
• A high salary that shows exceptional ability
• Membership in professional associations
• Recognition of achievements and contributions by professionals or organizations
• Other comparable evidence

Concrete evidence that places an individual at a higher level than his/her peers improves chances of NIW approval. Examples include a higher than average number of citations, media attention, patented technology currently in use, etc.

MT Law successfully represents individuals in many areas involving the U.S. national interest. We offer a high-level of personalization and take care to describe our clients’ achievements in detail and emphasize their importance to U.S. national interests through diligent comparative analysis.

It was created to protect American workers by ensuring immigrants are paid standard wages and that American workers have first-priority consideration for the job. The PERM process is very complicated and requires a high level of attention to detail, as even insignificant mistakes can result in denial.

The three major steps in the process are:

1. Obtain a prevailing wage determination for a specific job from the Department of Labor
2. Conduct a recruitment campaign to ensure no qualified U.S. workers are interested
3. Obtain labor certification for the immigrant to perform a specific job

MT Law has extensive experience in filing PERM applications for businesses of all sizes and stages of development. We provide training and consultation to first-time PERM employers, and we offer consistent PERM programming to established companies.

Most EB-2 petitions must start with the PERM process, which involves government determination of a minimum wage for the employee and extensive recruiting to determine that no U.S. worker is available for the position. Once the Department of Labor issues a labor certification at the end of that process, employers can sponsor their employees for permanent residence by filing Form I-140. Most immigrants can apply for permanent residence (green card) immediately after I-140 approval, but there are significant backlogs for immigrants from some countries.

Individuals with approved I-140s can apply for extensions of H-1B status until they are able to obtain a green card. This rule allows employees from China, India, and any other country with a backlog to remain in the United States while waiting for their green cards.

MT Law has significant experience with I-140 petitions, and regularly provides innovative solutions to companies seeking to move and retain talent in the United States.

        value: "Adjustment of Status",
        content: `The adjustment of status process starts with the filing of Form I-485 and allows eligible immigrants who are lawfully present in the United States to file for permanent residence in the United States. This process is open to almost any person who entered the United States in a lawful status, has an approved or pending application for immigrant status (usually Form I-140 or I-130), and does not have a visa backlog for their country. The U.S. Department of State issues a monthly “Visa Bulletin” which determines whether immigrant visas are available for each preference category, based on the immigrant’s home country. If the immigrant’s preference category is current, denoted with a “C”, then an immigrant visa is immediately available and the foreign national may apply to adjust their status and receive their green card without needing to travel abroad.

The application for an adjustment of status, Form I-485, is commonly filed with an application for employment authorization and an application for advance parole (travel authorization). Processing times can vary based on where the application is filed and under which basis the foreign national qualifies for an immigrant visa (also known as a green card or lawful permanent residence).

Typically, the application for advance parole is meant for individuals present in the United States; however, in extraordinary circumstances an individual outside of the United States may apply for and be granted advance parole to enter the United States. Since immigrants who have filed an I-485 application for permanent residence cannot usually leave the U.S. without cancelling the application, an advance parole document is useful because it allows these immigrants to travel during the lengthy processing of the I-485. Please note that advance parole only allows for entrance into the United States and is not considered being “admitted” into the United States, so it is usually impossible to file an application to adjust to a different legal status after receiving advance parole.

If you have any questions, or would like to review your eligibility for advance parole, please contact MT Law for a consultation.`,

To be eligible for the K-1 visa, the U.S. citizen spouse must prove that there is a bona fide intention to marry the fiancé, there are no legal impediments to marriage, and that the couple met in person within two years of the filing of the petition.

Once the U.S. citizen spouse files his or her application in the United States with USCIS, and the fiancé abroad is issued a K-1 visa at their local U.S. consulate after a scheduled interview, the fiancé may travel to the United States, marry, and adjust their status to that of a permanent resident.

An alien relative of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident will only be eligible for a green card upon the approval of an I-130 petition. Due to extensive visa backlogs for many countries, it can be months or years before an approved I-130 can be used to obtain a green card.

        content: `
    The EB-5 Regional Center Program began in 1990 to spur economic growth through job creation and investment by foreigners. Administered by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the EB-5 program directs foreign investment into projects that revitalize local economies. On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act which created new requirements for obtaining an EB-5 Visa. To qualify for a green card, 10 full-time positions must be created directly or indirectly through the invested capital.

Regional Centers, designated by the U.S. government, promote job creation in a defined geographic area. Regional center investment is ideal for investors because (1) the regional center investors will not need to manage the project directly and (2) the “10 full-time job opportunities” requirement includes all the job opportunities created by the investment funds in the project.
 
Currently, most of the regional center programs are Target Employment Area projects. A Target Employment Area can be 1) a rural area – defined as an area within a metropolitan statistical area or within the outer boundary of a city or town with a population of 20,000 or more – and 2) an area where the unemployment rate is at least 150% of the national average unemployment rate. For petitions filed past 3/15/2022, a $800,000 investment towards Target Employment Areas is needed to qualify for an EB-5 visa. 

EB-5 investment immigration is a core practice group at MT Law, and our attorneys have vast experience with regional centers.

To qualify for a green card, 10 full-time positions must be created directly through the invested capital.

While most EB-5 projects are accomplished through regional centers, investors have the option to bypass that structure with direct investment. This is a better option for investors who wish to retain control over the business they are investing in. However, the minimum amount is $1,050,000 for petitions filed past 3/15/2022 which is greater than investment needed for regional centers. Direct investment requires a strong business plan and demonstrated proof of ability to create jobs.

Any employee transferred through the L visa program must have spent at least one year out of the last three years working for a subsidiary/affiliate/branch office abroad. Additionally, both the foreign employer and the U.S. employer must be continuously operating during the term of the L-1 visa.

L-1 visas are available to companies of all sizes and stages of development, including companies that have been operating in the U.S. for less than one year. They are popular with established companies who use rotation programs or are staffing teams for growth and expansion. They are also popular among new offices with foreign ties because they allow businesses to transfer key leaders and experts from within their corporate group to the U.S. to initiate operations.

The standard for proving an executive, managerial, or specialized knowledge role is extremely high, and standards have tightened further over the past few years. It is important to understand the definitions applicable to each position and the extensive evidence needed to prove eligibility for L-1 classification.

The worker’s education and the job must be closely related.

Employers must pay all legal and government filing fees associated with H-1B petitions, and they must guarantee the worker the minimum prevailing wage calculated for the industry and geographic area. Employers must also pay return travel costs if they terminate employment of an H-1B worker.

H-1B applications are accepted each year starting at the beginning of April. Only 65,000 H-1B visas are authorized each year, with an additional 20,000 authorized for master’s degree graduates from U.S. institutions. In most recent years, this cap has been fully reached and even exceeded during the first week of April. When the cap is exceeded, USCIS conducts a random lottery of all H-1B petitions and returns all petitions not selected. It is essential to submit H-1B petitions during the first week of April to guarantee they will be considered in the lottery.

An initial H-1B visa is granted for a maximum period of 3 years, with the possibility to be extended for an additional 3 years, allowing a maximum H-1B stay of 6 years. Only time spent in the United States counts toward this time period, allowing workers to extend their stay further based on the amount of time they spent outside the U.S. over the 6 years in H-1B status. There are certain circumstances that allow further extension as well.

MT Law’s attorneys have extensive experience with H-1B programs, advising workers and companies of all sizes throughout the process. MT Law also offers full service H-1B programming for growing companies, ensuring that employers have the tools they need to maintain compliance without interruption to their workforces.

If you are a company who wishes to sponsor workers for H-1B visas, please schedule a consultation with one of our attorneys today.`,

Workers with a J-1 visa must be engaged in “teaching, instructing or lecturing, studying, observing, conducting research, consulting, demonstrating special skills, receiving training, or receiving graduate medical education or training.”

Many J-1 visitors are required to spend at least 2 years in their home country after the end of the J-1 program before they enter the U.S. again. This 2-year residency requirement may be waived in many situations.

MT Law works with sponsors, companies, and workers to ensure a smooth J-1 visa process for everyone involved. Our attorneys are also experienced with obtaining waivers of the 2-year residency requirement. If you are an employer or an individual interested in more information, please schedule a consultation today.`,

The key to a successful O-1 petition is demonstrating sustained acclaim (a pattern of high-level achievement and recognition), in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics. Individuals can qualify if they won a major internationally recognized award (Nobel, Oscar, Pulitzer, etc.), or they can qualify by proving at least 3 criteria, which vary based on the type of work.

Scientists, educators, businesspeople, and athletes/coaches must prove at least 3 of the following:

• Nationally or international prizes or awards
• Membership in associations that require members to have outstanding achievements
• Articles in professional or major media about the individual
• Original contributions of major significance
• Authorship of scholarly articles in professional journals or major media
• Significantly higher pay than others in the field, industry, or sport
• Participation as a judge of the work of others in the field, industry, or sport
• Employment in a critical/essential capacity in distinguished organizations or top companies

Artists (including those in the movie industry) must prove at least 3 of the following:

• Performing in a lead or starring role for a distinguished production or event
• Performing in a lead or starring role for a distinguished organization or establishment
• Acclaimed critical reviews or articles in major publications
• Commercial success in the performing arts
• Testimonials from experts and authorities showing significant recognition in the arts
• Significantly higher pay than others in the field

MT Law successfully represents extraordinary individuals in wide range of scientific disciplines, art, movies, music, education, business, and sports. In addition to working with extraordinary individuals in established and popular areas of work, we regularly obtain approvals for individuals in obscure scientific fields, lesser-known sports, and niche art. We offer a high-level of personalization and take care to describe our clients’ achievements in detail and emphasize their importance through diligent comparative analysis.

If you think you might qualify for O-1 classification, or if you would like to sponsor an employee, please contact us today for a consultation.`,

Applications for changing or extending status are not available for premium processing, and there may be significant processing delays that can impact ability to travel and authorization for work in the U.S. Applicants should carefully weigh their options before deciding to file an application.

      content: `Estate planning is the process of anticipating and arranging for the distribution of an estate during a person’s life. Estate planning typically attempts to ensure that a person’s wishes are carried out, avoids conflict due to ambiguity, eliminates the delay and expense of probate, and maximizes the value of the estate through strategic tax planning. The ultimate goal of an estate plan, however, is always determined by the specific goals of each client, and may be as simple or complex as the client’s needs and desires dictate.

Proper estate planning requires a relationship with a knowledgeable and experienced estate planning attorney. It requires thoroughness, understanding, and respect for the overall well-being of both you and your family, now and in the future. MT Law practices the highest ethical professional standards in dealing with our clients. We understand that there is no such thing as a “standard” estate plan, and we are dedicated to helping each and every client create an individualized plan that meets their personal goals.

In all cases, our objective is to help you feel comfortable with the estate-planning process, while creating a personally-tailored plan that helps you preserve your hard-earned legacy and provide a secure financial future for you and your loved ones. We provide a comprehensive array of estate-planning services, from simple wills and advance directives to complex trusts for high net worth individuals. Whatever your age and financial situation, our estate-planning attorneys can help provide you peace of mind in knowing you and your family are prepared for any contingency.`,
